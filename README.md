# Aragor's Celestial Quest

This repository contains the LaTeX source files for my character background story, "Aragor's Celestial Quest". The story is written in LaTeX to achieve a professional typesetting and formatting.

## Prerequisites

To compile the LaTeX files, you'll need a TeX distribution installed on your system. Some popular TeX distributions are:

- TeX Live (Linux, macOS, and Windows): https://www.tug.org/texlive/
- MiKTeX (Windows): https://miktex.org/
- MacTeX (macOS): https://www.tug.org/mactex/

The project uses the LuaLaTeX engine for compilation, which is included in all major TeX distributions.

## Compiling

To compile, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ssayin/aragor-s-celestial-quest.git
cd aragor-s-celestial-quest 
```
2. Compile the LaTeX document using `latexmk`:
```sh
make
```
