\begin{verse}
Only the wise in lunar magic's art \\
Could see the enigma of this fleeting time, \\
As the celestial visitor did impart \\
Its secrets in the sky's celestial climb.

The comet's fading light through layers flew, \\
Its message lost on those without insight, \\
But for those attuned to magic and the view, \\
It whispered of secrets beyond their sight.

The night, a blend of mundane and rare, \\
A paradox of the ordinary and the profound, \\
For those with the ability to see and dare, \\
The sky was a mystery waiting to be found.
