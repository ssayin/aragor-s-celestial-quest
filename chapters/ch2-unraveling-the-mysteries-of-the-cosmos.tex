Growing up, Aragor's life was anything but easy. His mother, Nephasser, was a woman obsessed with the occult, often neglecting her son in favor of her studies. As a result, Aragor was left feeling alone and emotionally distant from his mother. He withdrew into himself, and the childlike part of him was allowed to remain for far too long. Even as an adult, the armor of responsibility he donned couldn't entirely quell the repulsive child that lay dormant inside him.

Aragor's relationship with his mother was strained, and this left him unable to express his emotions or even understand his desires. He spent years wandering aimlessly through life, without any clear sense of purpose. He was prone to moments of impulsivity, but he reserved his deeper, more contemplative thoughts for moments of solitude. During these introspective times, he sought knowledge and enlightenment, without any clear purpose or conviction. The only thing that seemed to guide him was a desire for self-discovery and the realization of his true potential.

Although Aragor didn't enjoy reading, he was drawn to books with intriguing illustrations. After his mother's sudden disappearance, Aragor stumbled upon a few volumes hidden away in the Dark Vault of their home. It was in these volumes that he discovered the \textit{Aphotic Diary}, written by a certain Cornelius Lonelight.

The \textit{Aphotic Diary} contained powerful spells and otherworldly secrets, written in the Common language. The focus of the book was on necromancy, enchantment, and mind control, and Aragor found himself drawn to the book's dark and mysterious contents. Despite the dangers of dabbling in the forbidden arts, Aragor couldn't help but be fascinated by the power that Lonelight's knowledge held. The diary became a source of both fascination and fear for Aragor, sparking a desire within him to learn more about the author and his dark arts.

Another notable volume was \textit{A Treatise on Celestial Outsiders}, penned by his mother. The book was bound in a faded green leather cover, embossed with silver moons and stars. Its pages were yellowed with age and faintly musty, but the text within was a treasure trove of knowledge.

As Aragor delved into its contents, he discovered that the book was a comprehensive guide to the celestial beings that inhabited the skies above. It detailed their properties, histories, and even provided methods for summoning them. Aragor was fascinated by the descriptions of these creatures, which ranged from benevolent guardians of the night to malevolent tricksters.

In the preface, Aragor found a cryptic message that caught his attention. It spoke of the transformative power of magnetic energy, and how it could guide the emergence of miracles in the physical realm. This message left Aragor with a sense of intrigue, as he pondered the potential implications of such knowledge.

 As he read on, Aragor's mind was filled with visions of soaring through the stars on the back of a celestial being, of communing with the powerful entities that roamed the cosmos. The book stirred a sense of wonder and curiosity within him, igniting a desire to learn more about the mysteries of the universe.

Aragor couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to it than met the eye. He sensed that his mother had left hidden clues within its pages, clues that could unlock the true power of the celestial beings she wrote about. This suspicion led him on a quest to decipher the secrets of the book and unlock its full potential, a quest that would ultimately change the course of his life.
