The moment his mother vanished marked an indelible turning point in Aragor's life. With a newfound determination to escape the shadows of his past and forge a brighter future, Aragor immersed himself in the pursuit of work. He scoured the city, its labyrinthine alleys and sun-drenched plazas, seeking any job openings that he might have even the slightest chance of securing. After weeks of relentless searching, his efforts were rewarded with a position as a clerk in a bustling government office. There, he worked tirelessly each day, sifting through mountains of paperwork and providing assistance to the higher-ranking officials.

The vibrant energy of the bustling streets and the lively chatter of the marketplaces were a stark contrast to his isolated upbringing. As he walked the crowded streets, Aragor couldn't help but be reminded of his childhood, when he'd wander the dimly lit corridors of his mother's mansion, yearning for connection and purpose. 

But life in the city was not without its challenges. The cost of living was high, and Aragor struggled to make ends meet on his meager salary. Just as he began to find his footing, the king's unjust taxes began to eat away at his already depleted savings. Frustrated and at a loss for what to do, Aragor knew he needed to find a more lucrative opportunity before it was too late.

Enshrouded in contemplation, Aragor nursed a lukewarm ale as he sat in the dim corner of a bustling tavern. The flickering candlelight cast shadows on the walls, stirring recollections of his somber childhood. It was amid such contemplation that he found himself drawn to the tales of adventurers in taverns, their exploits serving as a beacon of excitement and potential fortune. 

On one fateful evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon and the air filled with the lively chatter of patrons, Aragor listened intently to a seasoned adventurer's harrowing journey through treacherous lands. The adventurer spoke of a mysterious figure, the mad priest Cornelius Lonelight, whose infamy had seeped like a dark mist throughout the land. Lonelight was revered for his arcane knowledge, dabbling in forbidden arts, and penning the \textit{Aphotic Diary}—a tome brimming with potent spells and otherworldly secrets.

A sudden unease gripped Aragor's heart as he realized he had unknowingly dabbled in the works of this perilous man. Tempted to question the adventurer about the enigmatic priest, a sense of self-preservation prevailed, urging him to conceal his connection to Lonelight's writings. Thoughts tangled in fear and curiosity, the knowledge of Lonelight's work cast a sinister shadow over his mind. He resolved to slip out of the tavern discreetly, unwilling to draw attention to his association with the mad priest's creations.

Aragor surreptitiously departed from the bustling tavern, his heart pounding against his ribcage. The shock of hearing Lonelight's name spoken aloud had shaken him to the core, and he felt an urgent need for solitude to process this revelation. As he retreated into the welcoming shadows, he pondered the implications this discovery held for him and his future endeavors.

In the weeks that followed, Aragor frequented the tavern, hoping to encounter the adventurer once more, driven by his yearning to uncover more about the mysterious priest. He began to believe that the knowledge gleaned from Lonelight's writings could unlock his true potential if he could only conquer his fear.

But fate had other designs. The adventurer never returned to the tavern. Hushed whispers among the patrons spoke of his sudden disappearance, with some suggesting a sinister force at play. These unsettling rumors heightened Aragor's apprehension regarding the mad priest's work. At the same time, they served as a reminder that he was alone in his journey, and he could not afford to entrust his secrets to others.

Over time, Aragor found comfort in the company of fellow wanderers and treasure-seekers, exchanging stories and camaraderie late into the night. The tavern's warm glow and the shared dreams of riches and glory offered a sense of belonging that had long eluded him. With each passing day, his resolve to embark on his own adventures grew stronger, and the desire to prove himself became an undeniable force.

The tales of adventure stirred something within him, awakening the dormant child eager for discovery and purpose. When Aragor overheard talk at the “Hopping Toad Inn” of a generous reward for clearing a mine of kobolds, it was as if the universe had aligned itself to provide him with the opportunity he had longed for—a chance to step out of the shadows and into a life of excitement and danger.

Aragor began preparing for his first foray into the unknown. He spent his days honing his skills and acquiring essential supplies, driven by the promise of adventure that lay just beyond the city gates. As the day of his departure drew near, the anticipation was almost unbearable, like a tightly wound coil, ready to spring into action.

Equipped with his arbalest and provisions for several days, he embarked on his first adventure, eager to make a name for himself and bring to life the dreams born from the pages of his mother's hidden books. As he set out on his journey, the memories of his past mingled with the thrilling uncertainty of the future, propelling him forward into a world of boundless possibility.
